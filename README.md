* [ ] 60% line coverage of all service layer classes
* [ ] Generated Jacoco reports that display coverage metrics
* [ ] Usage of the java.util.Stream API within your project
* [ ] Custom ORM source code should be included within the web application as a Maven dependency
* [ ] The application shall use Postman to test endpoints that call your server-side components.
* [ ] The application shall follow proper layered architecture
* [ ] The application shall implement log4j for appropriate logging.

### Stretch Goals:

* [ ] Custom ORM supports basic transaction management (begin, commit, savepoint, rollback)
* [ ] Custom ORM supports connection pooling
* [ ] Session-based caching to minimize calls to the database for already retrieved data
* [ ] Deployment of web application to AWS EC2 (use of AWS Elastic Beanstalk is permitted)
* [ ] Continuous integration pipelines that builds some main branch each project (the ORM and the web app, separately)
* [ ] Passwords shall be encrypted in Java and securely stored in the database.
