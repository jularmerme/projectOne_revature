- [ ] Completing assigned Model & Repository Layers 
- [ ] Starting on Services layer
- [ ] Unit Testing 
- [ ] Remember to review each others' code and push your work to your respective branch!

<br>

**Review**: The Service Layer calls what we specified in the Data Layer and adds business logic to it. This is where you would consider input validation, etc. 
- This layer will in turn be called on by the Controller layer.
